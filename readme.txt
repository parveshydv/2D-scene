Part 1 - Physical World and Character Control

What I Completed

1. Player Animations (Done)
I added Idle and Walk animations using a spritesheet. They change smoothly based on the Speed parameter.

2. Player Movement (Done)
Left, right, and jumping work. The player can only jump when on the ground.
Movement feels smooth with no wall sticking.

3. Player Collider (Done)
The character has a clean Capsule Collider that matches the sprite.

4. Tilemap Physics (Done)
I used a Tilemap Collider + Composite Collider for smooth ground contact.

5. Moving Platforms (Done)
I made one horizontal and one vertical platform.
Both move between two points.
I used collision callbacks so the player becomes a child of the platform when standing on it.

6. Camera Follow (Done)
The camera follows the player using simple parenting.

7. World Quality (Done)
I expanded my world so the player can move through multiple areas using platforms.
The world plays like a small demo.
