Assignment A1 - Part 2: 2D Platformer Scene
Name: Parvesh Yadav
Date: October 13, 2025

I have completed all the requirements from question 1 to 11 for Part 2 - 2D Platformer Scene.


4) TILEMAP, GRID, AND TILE PALETTE

I used Unity’s Tilemap, Grid, and Tile Palette tools to design the level layout.

Created a Grid object with three separate Tilemaps:

BackgroundTilemap

ForeGroundTilemap


Imported my tile sheets and sliced them using the Sprite Editor with correct grid cell sizes.

Created a Tile Palette and added all sliced tiles for painting.


All tiles are perfectly aligned to the grid, have consistent scaling, and are placed to form reachable platforms both vertically and horizontally.





(5) THREE DIFFERENT TILESHEETS

I used three different tilesheets containing a mix of background and foreground objects.

All tiles came from the Unity Asset Store package:
Pixel Adventure 1 : https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/pixel-adventure-1-155360





(6) SPRITE ATLAS

I created a Sprite Atlas and added all my tilesheets into it.


Everything has been completed successfully.
